	abstract = {Calorimetry at the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) faces two enormous challenges, particularly in the forward direction: radiation tolerance and unprecedented in-time event pileup. To meet these challenges, the CMS experiment has decided to construct a High Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL), featuring a previously unrealized transverse and longitudinal segmentation, for both electromagnetic and hadronic compartments. This will facilitate particle-flow-type calorimetry, where the fine structure of showers can be measured and used to enhance particle identification, energy resolution and pileup rejection. The majority of the HGCAL will be based on robust and cost-effective hexagonal silicon sensors with ≃ 1 cm2 or 0.5 cm2 hexagonal cell size, with the final five interaction lengths of the hadronic compartment being based on highly segmented plastic scintillator with on-scintillator SiPM readout. We present an overview of the HGCAL project, including the motivation, engineering design, readout/trigger concept and simulated performance.}

Clustering is in the eye of the beholder, and as such, researchers have proposed many induction principles and models whose corresponding optimization problem can only be approximately solved by an even larger number of algorithms. Therefore, comparing clustering algorithms, must take into account a careful understanding of the inductive principles involved.},
